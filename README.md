## Dungarvan Health Clinic
## Introduction (What the project is, why it exists, who it's intended for)
Dungarvan Health Clinic is a website for highlighting the holistic offerings of health services in one accessible health centre. 
We aim to showcase the services provided, the qualifications of its health practitioners and contact details to make a booking or request a call back. Existing and new patients will be able to access the contact services with ease.  
### Description Project Purpose 
If they wish to have the benefit of requesting a 'Call Back' with regard to a specific health category there is an easy to use form for this. The benefit of the 'Call-Back' form is useful for 2 main reasons - 
1. It allows patients who may be at work, or out of hours, or busy with childcare and opportunity to take action to making the first-step in contacting a health professional.
2. It allows for the Health practices itself to manage the appointments in a more efficient manner as it sees the category the patient is interested in and allows them to 'Call Back' in quieter clinic times.
### User Demographics - Target audience
The target audience is new and existing patients based in the Dungarvan area within a 20 mile radius.  It also aims to increase its patients from the county of Waterford needing specialist advice in areas such as 'Asthma management'. With the increase population of Ukrainian refugees we wanted to highlight the distinct advantage of having a Ukrainian doctor who would be able to communicate easily with our increasing Ukrainian population.  
## UX
### Color Scheme
We choose these color schemes as green is a calming color and purple is a healing color.  We checked which font color stood out best against these, both getting 5 star ratings.  Graphic illustrated below. 
### Typograpghy
We will use a Sans Serif font which is good for accessibility.  Dyslexix friendly font... 
Looks professional.
### Imagery 
We have professional head shots taken of each of our healhcare workers with the same background and similar style and size. 
All images contain 'alt' text so that it can be more accessible for screen readers and search engines.
### Wireframes
We created our wireframes to plan out the stucture and style of website and spoke with the users to gain their insigt and views.  This was created for  displaying site on mobiles, tablets and desktops.
